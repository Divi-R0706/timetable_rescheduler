📖 How It Works

Teachers and classrooms are registered in the system.

Availability data is stored in Firebase Firestore.

Cloud Functions process inputs and run scheduling algorithms.

Conflict-free timetables are generated and stored in Firestore.

AI provides suggestions to replace/reschedule a faculty if they are unavailable, using alternate faculty availability.

Any change in availability triggers real-time rescheduling.
